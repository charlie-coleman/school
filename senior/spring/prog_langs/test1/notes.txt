    Regular Expressions - sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string or pattern to be searched for within a longer piece of text
      Tokens - basic building blocks of programs. Shortest strings or characters with individual meaning
        E.G. - keywords, identifiers, symbols, constants, etc.
    DFA - deterministic finite automaton
        - in any given state with a given input character there is never more than one possible outgoing transition labeled by that character

    NFA - non-deterministic finite automaton
        - doesn't follow that rule for DFAs
      See figure 2.7 for rules to make one
