Chapter 1 Discussion Question 6
Charlie Coleman
	With many people, the thought of an engineer is matched with a picture of a smart but socially awkward or shy person. This can be true in many situations, so finding a CEO or other top level corporate employee who is tasked with business dealings and relations can be difficult when only considering engineers. This is why I believe that it is OK to consider people from all educational backgrounds for these positions. However, it is important to take some other considerations into account when looking at people from more business or economic backgrounds for a job in a large engineering firm. The person hired, in my opinion, should be familiar with the operations of the firm. If you hire a person who knows nothing about engineering, they may not understand some of the time that goes into the less grandiose things, thinking they are just a time waste instead of a necessary part of the engineering process.
	Take, for example, a very minor example that I am familiar with. I have worked as an intern in the IT department of a business, and the employees typically had no idea what was required to do for a lot of the problems they would run into, and simply insist that we fixed it quickly, even if there was no quick fix. I could imagine, if someone with that little interest in IT had gotten a job leading an IT team, that it would be a nightmare for anyone working there. This is why I personally believe that the person in charge of an engineering firm should have some interest and knowledge in the subject, but not be required to have a degree and have worked there for many years. Those people would definitely have the knowledge of the engineering side of things, but they may not be the greatest candidate for the business side, where everyday things are more like meetings with shareholders than designing parts. The best candidate possible has a balance of both sides.
