3. fprintf requires a file stream parameter, printf defaults to the stdout
4. "printf() ... write output to stdout, the standard output stream; fprintf() ... write output to the given output stream;"
5. Hello World!

7. #include <unistd.h>

9. Hello, World!; 14 characters
10. Prints out garbage from after the char buffer ends in memory. Write does not know how long the char buffer is, so it reads from memory after the buffer ends.
11. Use C library for cross-system compatibility, write for speed. e.g.:

time ./hello_write

real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys		0m0.002s


time ./hello_fprintf

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.000s
sys		0m0.003s
